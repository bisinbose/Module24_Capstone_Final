# Module24_Capstone_Final - Heart Disease Prediction

Analyze the heart disease dataset to explore the machine learning algorithms and build decision tree model to predict the disease.

Heart disease is easier to treat when it is detected in the early stages. Machine learning techniques may aid a more efficient analysis in the prediction of the disease. Moreover, this prediction is one of the most central problems in medicine, as it is one of the leading diseases related to an unhealthy lifestyle. So, an early prediction of this disease will be useful for a cure or aversion.

# Dataset
Data sourced through Kaggle which contains records of Patients in University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction/

# Expected Results
Analysis on the indicators to understand the effect of these indicators on heart health.
A Machine Learning classification model that predicts the presence or absence of a heart disease based on heart health indicators.
